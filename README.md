# bulleyes_app
my first swift app

Thanks to the https://www.raywenderlich.com/ I built my first Swift app named Bullseye, a mobile game with low functionality (for now) <br>
I have a few milestones to add functionality into the app 
1. button to open a game menu with leaderboard and main menu
2. page with leaderboard 
3. button to reset round 
4. field with round number on the game screen 
5. field with player's total score
