Thanks to the https://www.raywenderlich.com/ 🎉 I built my first Swift app named Bullseye, a mobile game with low functionality (for now) <br>
I have a few milestones to add functionality into the app 
1. button to open a game menu with leaderboard and main menu ❌
2. page with leaderboard ❌
3. button to reset round ❌
4. field with round number on the game screen ❌
5. field with player's total score ❌
